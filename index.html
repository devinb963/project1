<h2>Computer Science 1A</h2>
<p>In computer science 1A we are designing a final homepage including are everyday classes. We must include descriptions with pictures as well showing what we are doing in class. In your webpage there should be background image, pattern, or color. It should be atleast 5 CSS properties. Every subsequent webpage MUST be differentiable from the homepage and other pages. Also Link EVERY class title or image to another webpage that will contain detailed
information about your project. Each page shall include: Description of project, Image of project, Reflection about the project including what you learned as a result of the project
and how you may be able to apply what you have learned in the future.</p>

<h2>Algebra 2 1B</h2>
<p>In Algebra 2 we are doing a project formed around linear creation. We must create a box that is not cubed using linear equations. The dimensions of the box must be so that the total volume is more than 24 cubic inches but less than 500 cubic inches. When making our design we must be using desmos and animated so they can showcase their new design in an upcoming exposition.</p>

<h2>Chemistry 2A</h2>
<p>In chemistry we are learning how to do scientific notation for a upcoming project That we must do. In order for us to learn we have been assigned worksheets and different practices. We have also taken a test on scientific notation as well to make sure we better under stand. We are also learning how to do accurate scales. We have watched a couple videos in class as well as being assigned a couple videos to watch. In class we are doing labs that will better teach us about accuarate scales. </p>

<h2>World History 2B</h2>
<p>In world history we are currently doing a DBQ mini project. In this project we are informing readers about how and why the haitan, french, and latin revolutions started. In this project we must right a detailed 5 paragraph essay using evidence from documents given to us by our teacher. In these documents there is evidence as to how the revolutions started with picture examples to better help us as students understand. When putting our evidence we must cite where we got our evidence so that it better helps back up our arguement. In order for us to make sure that we understand our project a little more our teacher assigned us to do two body paragraphs and get feedback from our classmates so that we can better our writing. </p>

<h2>English10 3A</h2>
<p>In english 10 we are currently working on an on-going assignment called "What We Keep". In this assignment we have to think of a object that means very much to us and establish how it has played a role in our life-time. We also have been reading text that our teacher assigned to us to use as a guide in our writing. In mine personally I decided to talk about everything that had the biggest impact on my life Football, Djing, and Money. For our final draft we had to insert a picture of each and put a short story behind telling readers what the picture means. This assignment was not only meant for our teacher to get to know us a little bit better but to also work on our short story writing.</p>

<h2>Graphic Communications 3A</h2>
<p>In Graphic communications we are doing an assignment called "Humans of DVC" in this assignment we must interview a partner that has been assigned to us with a question board given to us. In these questions they must thourghly give a good satement answering the question so that in our final draft we can take all these satements and make them into one paragrapgh. We must also take a portrait picture of our partner so that when we do decide to write our paragraph there is a picture but also a mini story to back up the picture with their words.</p>
